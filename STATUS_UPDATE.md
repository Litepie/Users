### 📦 Current Package Status

#### ✅ **Working Components**
1. **Service Provider**: Fully functional, autoloads correctly
2. **User Models**: Enhanced with organization hierarchy fields
3. **Database Migrations**: Ready with organization schema
4. **API Routes**: Organization user endpoints configured
5. **User Types**: Organization user type properly extends base
6. **Configuration**: Complete user management configuration
7. **Facades**: Users facade properly registered

#### ⏳ **Pending Components** (Future Implementation)

2. **Notification Classes**: Can be added when needed
3. **Workflow Classes**: Integration with Flow package
4. **Controller Implementations**: API controllers for organization features

### 🚀 **What You Can Do Now**

#### 1. **Install Package Dependencies**
```bash
# The composer.json is ready
composer install

# Run migrations (when ready)
php artisan migrate
```

#### 2. **Basic User Management**
```php
use Litepie\Users\Facades\Users;

// Create a basic user
$user = Users::create([
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'email' => 'john@example.com',
    'password' => 'password123',
    'user_type' => 'user'
]);

// Create an organization user (basic)
$orgUser = Users::create([
    'name' => 'Jane Smith',
    'email' => 'jane@company.com',
    'password' => 'password123',
    'user_type' => 'organization',
    'organization_position' => 'Manager'
]);
```

#### 3. **User Management via API**
The API endpoints are ready:
- `GET /api/users` - List users
- `POST /api/users` - Create user
- `PUT /api/users/{id}` - Update user
- And organization-specific endpoints for later use

#### 4. **Configuration Customization**
The configuration file is comprehensive and ready for customization:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Litepie\Users\Providers\UsersServiceProvider" --tag="users-config"
```
